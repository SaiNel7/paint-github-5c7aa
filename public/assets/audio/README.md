# Audio Files Directory

This directory should contain your 8 MP3 audio files for the visualizer.

## Required Files

Add the following files to this directory:
- `track1.mp3`
- `track2.mp3`
- `track3.mp3`
- `track4.mp3`
- `track5.mp3`
- `track6.mp3`
- `track7.mp3`
- `track8.mp3`

## Recommendations

For the best visual experience, use tracks that:
- Are high quality (320kbps MP3 or higher)
- Have good dynamic range
- Include rich bass frequencies
- Match the chill beats aesthetic (lo-fi, ambient, etc.)

## Suggested Artists/Styles

The visualizer is designed for chill beats music similar to:
- Mac Miller
- ASAP Rocky
- Frank Ocean
- Yung Lean
- Lo-fi hip hop
- Ambient electronic
- Chillwave
- Synthwave

## After Adding Files

1. Update the track information in `src/assets/playlist.js`
2. Change the artist names and song titles to match your tracks
3. Ensure file paths match if you use different naming

## Demo Mode

If no audio files are present, the application will run in demo mode with silent audio tracks. The visuals will still respond to mouse movement and display the interface.
